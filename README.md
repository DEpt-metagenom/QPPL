# QPPL (Quick Phage PipeLine)

This tool is designed to aid the work with phages, that were sequenced using Nanopore technology. QPPL is using multiple tools to create and characterize phage genome assemblies while every data stays on the user's computer.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT. Code will be published *soon*.
